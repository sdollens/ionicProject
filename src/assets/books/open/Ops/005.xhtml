<p class="p9">No book&#x2014;whether edited or single authored&#x2014;is truly an individual effort. We are grateful to those who helped us improve the quality of this volume. First, we would like to thank Nadia Lyubchik for her support in preparing the manuscript for publication. Just as a script supervisor ensures the continuity of a feature film, Nadia kept track of all of the references, formatting, correspondence and countless other details necessary for the publication of this book. Our deepest thanks. We would also like to thank Peter Lindberg at Noba, who gave valuable feedback on a number of aspects of this project as well as specific chapters. We would also like to thank Cathy Casserly at the Carnegie Foundation for her input. Finally, we are grateful to the contributing authors for their eager participation in this project. The breadth and depth of their collective insights and experiences have made this volume everything an editor could hope for. This book was produced with the support of a grant from the Association for Psychological Science and we gratefully acknowledge their role. We would also like to thank David Ernst and George Veletsianos for providing informative peer review feedback and helping us to develop the book.</p>
