# ionic-epubjs

Sample project of how to use [Epub.js](https://github.com/futurepress/epub.js) in an Ionic 3 app. 

## How Epub.js is integrated

As just natively importing Epub.js after installing it via `npm` unfortunately doesn't work, I copied over the `build` directory of the npm package of epubjs from `/node_modules/epubjs` to `/src/assets/epubjs` and included `epubjs.min.js` in `index.html`. That way the `ePub` object is globally available and can be used in Typescript after declaring it with `declare var ePub: any;`.

## Functionality

* Open books
  * Load and render locally available books from `/assets/books`
  * Switch between different books
* Reading UI
  * Tap through pages by using "next" and "previous" buttons
  * Swipe pages to go to next or previous page
  * Tap the page to toggle a reading mode with no UI
  * Display page number the reader is currently on
  * Display total number of pages in book
  * Display chapter title the reader is currently in
* Table of Contents
  * Show the table of contents of a book
  * Tap chapter to go there
* Settings
  * Change font size
  * Change background color (and with it text color)
  * UI automatically adapts the toolbar color depending on the chosen background and text color
  * Change font family

## Development

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `ionic cordova prepare`
4. Run `ionic serve` or `ionic cordova run android|ios`

* There is a [Ionic v1 based "Ionic Reader"](https://github.com/Nipun04/Ionic-Reader) that also uses Epub.js. It claims to "fix iOS flickering" and also has additional features "Last location, Go to location, Bookmarks, Highlights"
